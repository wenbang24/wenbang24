# 👋 Hey, welcome to my profile!

I make (weird) keyboards and code a bit.
Have fun here!

## What languages do I speak?
I consider my Python skills to be pretty good, and my C++ skills to be ok. I usually do competitive programming problems with those.<br>
For web development, it's a random choice between vanilla HTML, Bootstrap 5 and React. Depends on how I'm feeling at the time.<br><br>
I also speak Chinese.
